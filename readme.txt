WeatherSync Plugin
Version 2.0

Introduction
------------

Hello, and thank you for downloading my Bukkit plugin.

This plugin syncs the weather in Minecraft with the real-world weather in
a set location. Simply set up the location and forget about it. 

It currently only supports the US and Canada officially. If you can make it 
work with other locations, please let me know how.

It uses wunderground as its source, so if you can make it appear on wunderground,
you should be able to make it work with this. If nothing else seems to be working,
grab the station ID and use that.

The weather for this is provided by WeatherUnderground: http://wunderground.com


Installation
------------

Simply drop WeatherSync.jar and the WeatherSync folder in your plugins folder,
then open the configuration file and set it up with the location you would like
to sync weather with. 

You NEED to configure the plugin before it will work.

Those upgrading from 2.0 will need to create a new configuration file. A lot has
changed, and your old file will not work! It is suggested that you rename your
old configuration file, then copy the new one over, then update the new one with
the details from your old configuration file.


Configuration
-------------

To configure this plugin, edit WeatherSync/config.yml. If you did not copy this
when you installed, grab it again to get the file. It will not work without
configuration. Any text editor should suffice.

The configuration options are explained in comments before each option. Comments
are the lines that begin with #. 


Support & Bug Reports
---------------------

You have a few options for this. The first is by directly emailing me. My email address is owner@cpprograms.net. 

Your other option is the thread on the Bukkit forums.

Either way, I will try to get back to you as soon as is reasonably possible.
